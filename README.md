# FA-resample

This repository contains R code that combines resampling with factor analysis so that we can not only measure the center of an identity, but also how tightly focused that identity is. Currently factor analysis gives a point estimate for a caseâ€™s position in factor space, but does not distinguish between cases that have tightly focused traits at exactly that position versus those who have eclectic traits for which that is merely an average.
